It's Juji. You probably know I went out my way to try to get in contact with you. I feel like it was a mistake. I have to remember all the times I tried to get your love and attention and you didn't want it. I feel like I tried so hard just for you to dismiss me when we were breaking up. I brought you clothes,food,I let you stay at my place even though my mom doesn't like me having males in the house. I fought with my family over you because we all knew you were on drugs. I acted like it wasn't happening because I wanted to be with you and help you with the things you didn't speak about. I quit cigs because I couldn't stand how I got screamed at over them. That was why, you screamed at me knowing I hate getting yelled at. It triggers me but you didn't give a fuck,you didn't even care I was crying and left your place. You were more upset with what my mom was going to say.You flirting with younger girls always rubbed me the wrong way because I've been molested myself. You flirted with my friend Liz too and made it to a big thing when you got caught. You asked me for a threesome knowing I felt insecure and uncomfortable with the offer because the girl was GORGEOUS. You think I don't know you were having sex with that girl in Boston. And you think I'm stupid,I saw you deleting messages. I was never stupid,let's get that straight. If anything I acted stupid and gave you the benefit of the doubt. I got love for you but I could never be in love with you again. I can never lower myself like that again. You were my best friend and I felt like you did me wrong. I still hope you the best,I still hope you're somewhere out there making that bag and that you're healthy and somewhat sober. This is probably going to be the last thing i ever write to you but I just wanted you to know that I fr tried my best to be the one for you and I'm sorry I couldn't be. Bye giraffe.
