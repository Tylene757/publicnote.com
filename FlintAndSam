There was a lot that I didn't tell you about myself because I was scared. I was scared because the last person I told my past to(my ex) is no longer in my life. It doesn't sit right with me that a stranger knows my secrets. I don't want you to be a stranger. I've liked you for a while but didn't know how to express that because I felt that you didn't like me. Like some days I felt like you did but other days I felt like you couldn't stand me. I still can't cook but you told me you liked lo mien one day so thats why I messaged you the teriyaki noodles that I'm always eating. You're with someone new now it hurts because it feels like I was never yours. I was just someone you used to past time..I'm going to admit I used you to get over my ex for a little but I did develop feelings after we told each other we wouldn't. I feel stupid every time I write to you cause it feels like you don't feel the same way. At the end of the day all I want is for you to happy,whether that me with me or another lucky lady. I'm sorry if I gave you mixed feelings,it wasn't my intention to do that. Need to be better at communicating. Hope you've been doing good,miss you Flint
