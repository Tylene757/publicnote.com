I don't know who to believe in that situation. If you didn't do that to the blunt,that's fine I'm sorry for accusing you. But the way shit happened on social media and you didn't defend me. That was so fucked up. And also you were tapped,the way you yelled at me and got in my face and hit things. I hope you've healed from things you don't talk about. I get scared when someone raises their voice at me because of you.
